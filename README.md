# WatzTheEngineer's 2023 personnal Portfolio

This repo contains my 2023 personal portfolio, which was done as a school project. It is inspired by 
**[Bokoko33's award-winning website](https://bokoko33.me/)**. 
Thanks to [Andrew Woam](https://www.youtube.com/@andrewwoan) 
for providing [this repository](https://github.com/andrewwoan/abigail-bloom-portolio-bokoko33). General theme 
(Mars landing) provided as an exercice during my first year of **university course in IT and computing**.
